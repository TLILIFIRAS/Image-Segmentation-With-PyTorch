# Image-Segmentation-With-PyTorch

## Project Overview
This project focuses on image segmentation using a custom dataset and state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (Unet). We apply data augmentation techniques and leverage the Albumentations library to enhance model performance.

## Key Achievements

- **Custom Dataset Class**: We developed a custom dataset class tailored for image-mask pairs, ensuring efficient data organization.

- **Data Augmentation**: Utilizing Albumentations, we applied segmentation augmentation to both images and masks, improving model robustness.

- **Visual Insights**: We visually explored the dataset by plotting image-mask pairs, gaining valuable insights.

- **State-of-the-Art Model**: Loaded a pretrained Unet model using the Segmentation Models PyTorch library for top-tier performance.

- **Training Functionality**: Created train and evaluator functions to efficiently train the model and evaluate its performance.
